## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Obstacles

- For some reason the anchor tag or any hyperlink function inside the summary-card div is not working. I cannot hyperlink anything inside that div. Someone please help me find the solution. As of now, the Continue button does not work.
- Because of the above mentioned problem, the hover function was also not working.
- I am not familiar with the JSON files concepts yet. I will make use of it as I learn more.
